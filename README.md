# Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Assignments

Interesting projects I worked on as part of the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree. Completed and submitted as .ipynb files on Udacity course website originally, received after grading as .zip files.

Project 1 uses a basic CNN for facial keypoint detection, while Project 2 uses a much more powerful CNN as an encoder in tandem with an LSTM decoder to caption images.
